! This is a test case for setting integral constraint over a boundary.
! Here the integral over temperature should be exactly one. 
! The constraint allows setting the temperature without actually
! defining the profile. The user may plot the temperature over line
! to deduce that it is averaging at one but is has a physical profile.
