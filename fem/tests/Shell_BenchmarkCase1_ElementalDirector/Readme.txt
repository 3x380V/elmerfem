! Solve nonlinear shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
! a cylindrical benchmark problem with membrane-dominated asymptotic behaviour in 
! the linear regime. The linearized problem has been described in 
! Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell deformation states and the finite element method: 
! a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics 
! and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121. As opposed to the reference, here the shell
! problem is treated as nonlinear but the shell is subject to a small load 
! so that nonlinear effects are not yet significant.
