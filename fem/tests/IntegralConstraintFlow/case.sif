! This is a test case for setting integral constraint over a boundary.
! Here the integral over normal "velocity 1" should be exactly one.
! The constraint allows setting the incoming velocity without actually
! defining the profile.
!
! To plot the profile in matlab/octave
! load f.dat; plot(f(:,5),f(:,7))
