! In this example particles are under the influence of electrostatic force for a while.
! The electrostatic field has value 1 and when the charge is 1 the force is also 1.
! Under 1s this should result to kinetic energy of 1/2 - as is seen in the fitted solution. 
! Periodic BCs are enforced on the particles. Basically these features were implemetented
! during MMM@HPC project but added to the test set much later.
!
! Compared to base case this includes also magnetic field completing the Lorentz force
! f=eE + q v x B
