! Solve linearized 2-D shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
! a straight cylindrical shell with membrane-dominated asymptotic behaviour.
! The problem has been described in Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell deformation states 
! and the finite element method: a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. 
! Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121. Here
! the shell equations are written in lines of curvature coordinates (y1 = 
! angular direction, y2 = axial direction) and a special solver code is
! employed to handle the problem using the exact surface parametrization.
!
! This test provides a case for verification of the p-version of FEM.
! The energy norm of the error for different p-element definitions (over the
! same 2 X 2 mesh) is found to be as follows (the shell thickness d=0.1): 
!
! p:1       Relative energy error =   0.88896260271790639
! p:2       Relative energy error =   0.29814339193540801 
! p:2 b:1   Relative energy error =   0.23711572317485702
! p:3       Relative energy error =   0.17701104808582918
! p:3 b:4   Relative energy error =    3.7584671594097008E-002
! p:4       Relative energy error =    3.4526616304186068E-002
! p:5       Relative energy error =    7.8498375202090825E-003
! p:6       Relative energy error =    2.4502183740983921E-003
! p:7       Relative energy error =    6.0846479859093326E-004
! p:8       Relative energy error =    1.3328077843970739E-004 
! p:9       Relative energy error =    6.7817426835655489E-005
!
! For a very high p errors from floating-point arithmetic may limit the 
! obtainable accuracy.
