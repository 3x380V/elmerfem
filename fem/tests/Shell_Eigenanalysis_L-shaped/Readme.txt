This case gives an eigenanalysis model for a cantilever which has an L-shaped 
cross section. The results have been verified by comparing against other models
of the same problem.

The default shell model which takes into account the straining of the shell 
director may not be convenient in cases where the director field is not
smooth. Here a drilling rotation formulation is used instead in order to handle
the discontinuity of the shell field.
