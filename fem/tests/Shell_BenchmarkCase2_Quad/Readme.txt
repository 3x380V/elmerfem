This test case is the cylindrical benchmark problem by Pitkäranta et al. with
bending-dominated asymptotic behaviour. The problem has been described in 
Pitkäranta et al. Shell deformation states and the finite element method: a benchmark study
of cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121.  

Results below: The error of strain energy as the mesh is refined as

Element Divisions 1 = 1 16 1  
Element Divisions 2 = 1 8 8 1
