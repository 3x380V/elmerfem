Solve nonlinear shell equations in the case of a cylindrical benchmark 
problem with bending-dominated asymptotic behaviour in the linear regime. 
The linearized problem has been described in Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell 
deformation states and the finite element method: a benchmark study of 
cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 
1995. 128:81-121. As opposed to the reference, here the shell
problem is treated as nonlinear, but the shell is subject to a small load 
so that nonlinear effects are not yet significant.

Here the problem is solved by using a high-order discretization which is 
currently possible with special surface geometries only. This option needs
a special command "Cartesian Formulation = Logical True".
