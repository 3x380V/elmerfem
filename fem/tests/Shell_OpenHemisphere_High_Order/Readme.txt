A benchmark problem where an open hemispherical shell is subject to point
loads. The reference results can be found in Sze KY, Liu XH, Lo SH. Popular 
benchmark problems for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells. Finite 
Elements in Analysis and Design 2004, 40(11):1551-1569.

Here the problem is solved by using a high-order discretization over a 2-D 
domain. This option needs a special command "Cartesian Formulation = 
Logical True".
