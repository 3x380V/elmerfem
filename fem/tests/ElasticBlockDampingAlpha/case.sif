! This is a consistency test for a transient case with only inertia
! resisting the movement under constant force and Rayleigh Damping.
! If the damping is large compared to the inertia it will fully dominate
! the speed. Here the rho=0.001 and alpha=1e3 so the solution should be
! closely r=f at 1s.
!
! Both nonlinear and linear solvers are tested within the same test.
