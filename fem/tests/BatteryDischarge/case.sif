! Test case for battery development.
! This is the discharge test case in Master's thesis. 
!
! Here Solvers 1 & 2 are iterated until converged for each timestep,
! thereafter solver 3 & 4 are solved only once.
!
! It was difficult to obtain convergence. The following tricks are used:
! - Electrostatic equations only are iterated as coupled system $npass times 
! - Concentration equations are only updated once for given potential
! - The equilibrium potentials are kept constant during concentration computations
! - The solid state concentration has a maximum allow change, $dcsmax
! - Currently 2nd order mesh is used, this enables use of strong form of diffusive source for Ce
! - Sensitivity of solution is used for linearization of Phis, Phie, Ce (but not of Cs)
!
! Notes on accuracy:
! - Even the current accuracy is not very good. One could increase $nss or decrease $sstol
! - There is a heavy computational cost in large number of iterations
