! This is test case for harmonic GCR coupled fluid-structure-interaction
!
! A "shoebox" with an elastic lid is being pressed with a force that causes
! the box to shrink in size. As an effect there is a counterforce due to ideal
! gas acting as a spring to the other direction.
!
! The harmonic gas is presented by the Helmholtz equation.
! For the elasticity equation the plate solver in harmonic mode is used.
! Still the system of equations is solved as a real system, for now.
