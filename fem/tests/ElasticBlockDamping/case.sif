! This is a consistency test for a transient case with only standard
! damping resisting to movement. Even inertia is set to zero. 
! The solution may be computed analytically and for unity damping
! the solution should be r=f at 1s.
!
! Both nonlinear and linear solvers are tested within the same test.
