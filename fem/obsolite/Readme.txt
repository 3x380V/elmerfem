This directory includes some ElmerSolver modules that have been
deemed obsolite as no one has been asking about them for years
and they probably don't reflect the current best practices of Elmer
in terms of coding style either.

If you're interested in these modules and their documentation please
contact Elmer team at CSC, or the module authors, for more info.
