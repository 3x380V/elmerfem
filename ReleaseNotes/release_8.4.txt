Previous release: 8.3
Period covered: 18 May 2017 - 18 Dec 2018
Number of commits: ~750 (excluding merges)



ElmerSolver library functionality
----------------------------


Block preconditioning
---------------------
- Block treatment has two main uses
  o Split up monolithic equations into subproblems that are easier to solve
  o Combine linear multiphysical coupled problems into a block matrix
  o These are usually best solver with outer Krylov iteration using GCR

- Implement new experimental ways to split existing linear system
  o Into Re and Im blocks for complex solvers
  o Into horizontal and vectical (hor-ver) degrees of freedom for lowest order edge elements
  o Into cartesian direction for fully cartesian edge element meshes
  o These might not be fully operational particularly in parallel
  o Constraints dealt as additional blocks

- FSI: Implement ways to combine fluid and structure solvers to form a block matrix
  o Library routines used to create the couping matrices
  o Limited to nodal degrees of freedom
  o Currently assumed linear solvers for the different fields
  o Test cases exists for a number of combincatins of structure and fluid solvers
  o Structure solver can be linear plate solver, shell solver, or stress solver
  o Ffluid solver can be Helmholtz solver, for example


Linear solvers
--------------
- Pseudocomplex gcr implemented to be used mainly in conjucnction of block preconditioners
- Enable any transient solver to be solved as harmonic when > Hamonic Mode = True < keyword is given.
  o Also harmonic field is named for visualization
  o Can be used in conjuction with block preconditioning
- In Hypre interface adapted during the solution procedure although
  a previously constructed Hypre solver is utilized. This feature depends on
  giving the command Linear System Adaptive Tolerance = True.
- Added > Linear System Min Iterations < parameter to HutIter structures and applied it
  to the built-in GCR iterative method. Sometimes block preconditioning needs more than one iteration.
- Linear solver strategy that uses namespaces to try out different strategies until convergence is reached.
  Currently only own Krylov methods and direct methods supported.
  Activates by >Linear System Trialing = Logical True< and the linear solver strategies with namespaces.
- When using >filename numbering< in SaveScalars only update the file number the 1st time visiting the subroutine.


Dirichlet conditions
--------------------
- Dirichlet conditions were totally reformulated
  o Separates the detection and assigning of the conditions
  o Makes many follow-up steps easier, e.g. optiomal scaling of the linear system
- Some fix for nontrivial bounndary conditions for p-elements


Non-nodal field types
----------------------
- Better support for different field types
  o nodal, elemental, dg, ip 
  o New types supported for exported variables
  o ListGetElementalReal operations may depend on these variables types
  o Ip fields may depend on adaptive Gaussian quadratures
  o Initialization improved for non-nodal fields
  o Exported variables may be used to make them active only in subsection on where the primary solver is.   
  o Mask is a logical keyword in Body Force section given my keyword >Exported Variable i Mask<

Derived fields
---------------
- Restructure the computation of derived fields
- Enable exported variables to be transient and their velocity be saved


Adaptive quadratures
--------------------
- GaussPointsAdapt implemented to allow higher integration rules within a band


Reduced basis DG
----------------
- Enable solution of PDEs using "reduced basis dg" where discontinuities are only present between bodies.
  This allows for a more economical treatment of discontinuities than having a complete discontinuous
  Galerkin method.
- Also it is more flexible than having the discontinuity created in the mesh.
  There are multiple ways how the bodies can be grouped when creating discontinuities between them.
    

Zoltan interface
----------------
- Added preliminary Zoltan interface to allow parallel mesh repartitioning for purposes of load
  balancing/initial mesh distribution.
- Allows serial meshes to be parallelised within Elmer and distributed to processors.
- Also allows load rebalancing during simulations following mesh modification.
- Still work in progress. 


MMG interface
--------------
- Added library interface to MMG 3D for performing remeshing and mesh adaptation functions via API.
- 3D meshes can be adapted based on user-defined metrics, and domain geometry can be chopped (e.g. fracture events)
  using a level set method. MMG functions are serial only, but routines have been added to isolate subregions of
  the mesh requiring adaptation, reducing overall computational cost.
- Still under developent. 


Internal partitioning
---------------------
- Routines allow to skip the separate partitioning routine with ElmerGrid
- Does not deal with halos yet.
- Either geometric routine, or any routine by Zoltan.
- Keywords to Zoltan passed by namespace 'zoltan:'
- Own strategies have limited support for hybrid partitionin


EOF library
-----------
. Separate library developed by Juris Vencels, see https://eof-library.com/
- Some of the general developments of Elmer motivated by a streamlined operation for the EOF library,
  e.g. the improved support for different field types. 

Miscallenous
------------
- Enable _post solver slot for single solvers to have cleaner routines. 
- Enable > Output Directory < keyword also in Simulation section such that SaveScalars,
  SaveLine, and VtuOutputSolver can use a common target directory more easily.
- Enable using Solver specific mesh with of #partitions different from  #mpitasks.
- Read command line arguments when there are more than 1 MPI task as well.
  This should make ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO file superfluous.
